    "    * Use stop loss that follows the price upward and resets each time the stock price hits a new high\n",
    "    * Additional functionality:\n",
    "        1) Protect against downside moves with options trading\n",
    "            * Buy put options on long positions (only buy 1) after running certain amount higher than previous high\n",

    "    * Focus on stocks that have an especially negative reaction from the market (-2%)\n",
    "    * Open long position and use stop loss\n",
    "#### Breakout Strategy\n",
    "    * Look at past highs and generate buy signals as soon as price manages to break out from its previous high\n",
    "    * Use dynamic lookback ranges based on volatility\n",
    "        * When volatility is high, look further back\n",
    "        * When low, look less\n",

    "1) Identify the Candidate: Find stocks that have built strong support or resistance levels and watch them. Remember, the stronger the support or resistance, the better the outcome. Make sure you understand this when you shop for stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Wait for the Breakout: Finding a good candidate does not mean a trade should be taken prematurely. Wait patiently for the stock price to make its move. To be sure the breakout will hold, on the day the stock price trades outside its support or resistance level, wait until near the end of the trading day to make your move.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Set a Reasonable Objective: If you are going to take a trade, set an expectation of where it is going. If you don't, you won't know where to exit the trade. This can be done by calculating an average move the stock makes or measuring the distance between support and resistance (especially when trading price patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Allow the Stock to Retest: This is the most critical step. When a stock price breaks a resistance level, old resistance becomes new support. When a stock breaks a support level, old support becomes new resistance. In the majority of your trades, the stock will test the level it has broken after the first couple of days. Prepare for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Know When Your Trade/Pattern Has Failed: When the stock attempts to retest a prior support or resistance level and it breaks back through it, this is where a pattern or breakout has failed. It is imperative you take the loss at this point. Don't gamble with your losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Exit Trades Toward the Market Close: You can't discern at the open whether prices will hold at a particular level. This is why you might consider waiting until near the market close to exit a losing trade. If a stock has remained outside a predetermined support or resistance level toward the market close, it is time to close the position and move on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Be Patient: This strategy requires plenty of patience. By following these steps, you will reduce emotion and be more objective about a trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Exit at Your Target: If you are not exiting the trade with a loss, then you are in the trade. You should remain in the trade until the stock price reaches its objective or you reach your time target without hitting your target price."
