    "        1) Protect against downside moves with options trading\n",
    "            * Buy put options on long positions (only buy 1) after running certain amount higher than previous high\n",

    "    * Open long position and use stop loss\n",
    "#### Breakout Strategy\n",
    "    * Look at past highs and generate buy signals as soon as price manages to break out from its previous high\n",
    "    * Use dynamic lookback ranges based on volatility\n",
    "        * When volatility is high, look further back\n",
